# Bootcamp projects
There are three projects in this repository, created as part of my bootcamp course: 
- Inventory
- GreetlySite
- Task Manager

# Inventory 
This script, inventory.py, is a simple inventory management system for a shoe store that uses a text file, inventory.txt, to store and manage a list of products and their stock levels.

## Installation
To use this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

You will also need the inventory.txt file in the same directory as the inventory.py script.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run it from the command line using the following command:

`python inventory.py`

The script will read the contents of the inventory.txt file and prompt you to choose from a list of options, including:

- View all
- Add product to inventory
- Search inventory by product code
- View the value of stock
- Update product stock level
- Decide sale items
- Exit
Simply follow the prompts to perform the desired action.

# Task Manager
Task Manager is a simple Python-based program that helps manage tasks and the users who can use the program. The program uses two text files, tasks.txt to store and write tasks to, and users.txt which keeps a list of users.

## Installation
To use this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

You will also need the user.txt file in the same directory as the tasks.py script.

To use the script, simply run it from the command line using the following command:

`python task_manager.py`

The program reads from tasks.txt for the programs tasks and reads user.txt for login details of users. 
The program includes the following features:

An admin menu that allows the user to:
- Register a user

- View all tasks
- Generate reports
- Display statistics
- Exit

A non-admin menu that allows the user to:
